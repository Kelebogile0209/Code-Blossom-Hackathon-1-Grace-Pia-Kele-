# Code-Blossom-Hackathon-1-Grace-Pia-Kele-
This repository is for Our first Hackathon in Code blossom;
The contributors are Grace Pia and Kele.
# Selected task :
My team members and I wanted to do a task that was simple but complex considering our skills and knowledge.
We then came up with a To-do list to allow indiviuals to keep track of theyre tasks.
This was the best option for us considering that all of us had just finished cgapter 2 and started chapter 3 recently.
# Challenges faced :
The biggest challenge faced throughout this entire project was collaborating our logic and code together. 
We experienced a lot of problems and syntax errors whilst doing this, because it all had to make sense with everyone elses input.
But fortunatley we were able to make sense of everything and make it work.
Another problem we faced was using the Git hub repository. Some of us were not familiar with it so we tried our best teach and learn how it works at the same time which took 
up a lot of time. 
# Tools used:
the complier that we used to do our work was Visual Studio code
We used HTML to create our User Interface
We also used JavaScript for the functionality in our UI.
# Overall takebacks :
we learnt a lot about how JavaScript functions and HTML functions work together. 
We also learnt a lot of functions such as EventListners and how functions really work.
We learned the importance of team work and how doing things together makes thingas a lot more easier.
